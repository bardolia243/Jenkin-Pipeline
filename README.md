Introduction
This Jenkins pipeline is designed to be triggered automatically when changes are pushed to the Develop branch of the Git repository. The pipeline fetches the content from the Git repository and places it in a designated folder.

Requirements
To run this Jenkins pipeline, you'll need:

Jenkins installed and configured.
A Git repository with a Develop branch.
Jenkins Git Plugin installed.
Usage
Clone this repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/git-triggered-jenkins-pipeline.git
Change into the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd git-triggered-jenkins-pipeline
Copy the Jenkinsfile and scripts folder to your project repository.

Adjust the Jenkinsfile as needed, modifying the Git repository URL, branch, and target folder.

Create a new pipeline project in Jenkins.

Configure the pipeline to use the Jenkinsfile from your project repository.

Set up a webhook in your Git repository to trigger the Jenkins pipeline on each push to the Develop branch.

Pipeline Configuration
The Jenkins pipeline is configured using a Jenkinsfile. Adjust the stages, steps, and configurations in the Jenkinsfile based on your specific requirements.

groovy
Copy code
pipeline {
    agent any

    triggers {
        // Trigger the pipeline on each push to the Develop branch
        pollSCM('*/5 * * * *') // Poll every 5 minutes, adjust as needed
    }

    stages {
        stage('Checkout') {
            steps {
                // Checkout the code from the Develop branch
                checkout([$class: 'GitSCM', branches: [[name: '*/Develop']], userRemoteConfigs: [[url: 'your-git-repo-url']]])
            }
        }

        stage('Pull Git Content') {
            steps {
                script {
                    // Pull Git content to a specific folder
                    sh 'mkdir -p target-folder'
                    sh 'cp -R * target-folder/'
                }
            }
        }

        // Add more stages as needed
    }

    post {
        success {
            // Add post-build actions here
        }
    }
}
Adjust the Git repository URL, branch, and target folder in the Jenkinsfile according to your project's structure.
