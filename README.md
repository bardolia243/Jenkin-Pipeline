# Jenkins Pipeline

This project demonstrates how to set up a Jenkins pipeline that is triggered by Git pushes to the Develop branch. The pipeline pulls the Git content and stores it in a specific folder.

## Introduction

Explain the purpose of this Jenkins pipeline assignment. Briefly describe what the pipeline is expected to achieve and how it fits into the development workflow.

## Requirements

To run this Jenkins pipeline, you'll need:

- Jenkins installed and configured.
- A Git repository with a Develop branch.
- Jenkins Git Plugin installed.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
    ```

2. Change into the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd your-repo
    ```

3. Copy the Jenkinsfile to your project repository.

4. Adjust the Jenkinsfile as needed, modifying the Git repository URL, branch, and target folder.

5. Create a new pipeline project in Jenkins.

6. Configure the pipeline to use the Jenkinsfile from your project repository.

7. Set up a webhook in your Git repository to trigger the Jenkins pipeline on each push to the Develop branch.

## Pipeline Configuration

The Jenkins pipeline is configured using a Jenkinsfile. Adjust the stages, steps, and configurations in the Jenkinsfile based on your specific requirements.

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any

    triggers {
        // Trigger the pipeline on each push to the Develop branch
        pollSCM('*/5 * * * *') // Poll every 5 minutes, adjust as needed
    }

    stages {
        stage('Checkout') {
            steps {
                // Checkout the code from the Develop branch
                checkout([$class: 'GitSCM', branches: [[name: '*/Develop']], userRemoteConfigs: [[url: 'your-git-repo-url']]])
            }
        }

        stage('Pull Git Content') {
            steps {
                script {
                    // Pull Git content to a specific folder
                    sh 'mkdir -p target-folder'
                    sh 'cp -R * target-folder/'
                }
            }
        }

        // Add more stages as needed
    }

    post {
        success {
            // Add post-build actions here
        }
    }
}
